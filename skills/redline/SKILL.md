name: redline
description: Write documents that sound like the user by learning from (draft → final) revisions. Use when drafting, revising, or reviewing any writing — emails, PRDs, memos, proposals, blog posts, social posts — and whenever the user shares a draft alongside the version they actually sent. Stores pairs, lessons, and matchable patterns in a local SQLite db via the `redline` CLI or MCP server.

# redline

Make any piece of writing sound like the user. The system learns from **(draft, final)** revision pairs and automatically lints future drafts against stored voice patterns. One DB, all content types — lessons cross-pollinate across formats.

## Where the data lives

- DB: `~/.redline/redline.db` (shared by CLI, MCP server, and Tauri app). Override with `REDLINE_DB=/path/db`.
- CLI: `redline` (on PATH)
- MCP server: `redline mcp` (stdio, auto-configured in pi)
- Tauri app: `cd redline-app && bun run tauri dev`

No LLM calls from the CLI/server. You do all reasoning in-session.

## Linting external writing

Not everything needs the draft→finalize loop. For quick writing that goes directly to external systems — Linear comments, Google Docs, Slack messages, social posts — just lint first:

```
lint(content)
```

Returns violations only. No draft created, no lifecycle, no learning. Fix violations, then post to wherever it's going.

## The draft workflow

When a piece of writing needs the full learning loop, follow these steps:

`create_draft` returns `pending_lessons` — finalized pairs that have no derived lessons yet. Before writing a new draft, process them:

1. For each pending pair, call `analyze_diff` or `show_pair` to see the diff
2. Derive 1–3 concrete lessons (see step 4 for how)
3. Store them with `add_lesson` + `add_pattern`

This clears learning debt. The patterns you derive improve the draft you're about to write — process them first.

### 1. Create the draft (patterns + transcript injected automatically)

Via MCP:
```
create_draft(content, context, tags, transcript)
```

Via CLI:
```
redline draft <file> --context "topic + audience" --tags email,external
```

**Match the format to the content type.** A document is not an email. If the user asks for a memo, PRD, or reference document:
- Use markdown headings (`## Section`), bullet lists, tables
- Do NOT add "Subject:" lines, "Hi [name]," greetings, or email sign-offs
- Structure as a reference document with sections, not as a message to a recipient
- The first tag should be `memo`, `prd`, `internal-doc`, or `content` — not `email`

**Transcript is captured automatically.** When running inside pi, redline detects the active session and pulls the conversation transcript programmatically — you don't need to pass it. This gives the async derivation daemon the full context behind each draft. The transcript is frozen at draft time and used later to understand *why* edits were made.

The response returns the draft id **PLUS all stored voice patterns, any lint violations, and pending unlearned pairs**. The patterns are your constraints — they represent what the user's voice does and doesn't do. Fix violations with `save_revision` before showing the draft to the user.

**If there are violations**: rewrite to resolve them, save the revision, check the returned violations again. Repeat until clean.

### 2. Hand off to the user

Tell the user the draft is ready. They will edit it — in the Tauri app, in Gmail, in Google Docs, in Obsidian, wherever. You don't control this step — wait for them to tell you they're done (or check `redline drafts` to see status).

If the user edits outside the app: they paste back the final version, and you call `add_pair(draft, final, context, tags)`.

### 3. Finalize (analysis + promotion returned automatically)

When the user has finalized:

```
redline finalize <draft_id>
```

Returns the pair id **PLUS diff analysis** (deletions, additions, word swaps, categorized changes, existing pattern hits) and any **auto-promoted patterns** (patterns that hit 3+ pairs auto-confirm).

### 4. Derive lessons from the analysis

Read the analysis. Focus on:

- **Deletions** — what got cut entirely (strongest voice signal).
- **Categorized changes** — each hunk tagged as deletion, structural, stylistic, factual, or punctuation.
- **Word swaps** — specific before→after replacements.

Derive 1–3 concrete lessons per pair. A good lesson is specific, actionable, and voice-coded:

- ✅ "No em-dashes in client-facing writing" → store as a pattern
- ✅ "Use 'quick note' not 'I wanted to reach out'" → store as pattern + lesson
- ✅ "Lead with the number in investor updates" → store as pattern + lesson
- ❌ "Be clear and professional" → useless, reject it

Store each lesson: `redline add-lesson <pair_id> "<lesson>" --tags email,external`
Store a matchable pattern: `redline add-pattern --rule "<rule>" --pattern "<match>" --category style`

**Always create a pattern alongside a lesson.** Lessons without patterns don't lint. That's the write loop — patterns catch voice issues in future drafts automatically.

## Key tools

| CLI | MCP | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| — | `lint` | Lint any text against voice patterns — no draft needed |
| `draft` | `create_draft` | Write draft, pass transcript, get patterns + violations + pending lessons |
| `finalize` | `finalize_draft` | Finalize pair, get diff analysis + promotions back |
| `analyze <pair_id>` | `analyze_diff` | Deep-dive: deletions, categorized changes, swaps, hits |
| `add-pattern` | `add_pattern` | Create matchable voice pattern (literal or regex) |
| `list-patterns` | `list_patterns` | See all patterns the lint engine uses |
| `promote` | — | Manually trigger pattern promotion |
| `add-lesson` | `add_lesson` | Store a derived voice lesson |
| `lessons` | `list_lessons` | Read all lessons |
| `show <id>` | `show_pair` | Read a pair with diff (lines/sentences/side-by-side) |
| `recent N` | `recent_pairs` | Skim recent finals |
| `feedback` | `give_feedback` | Log what's painful (bugs, suggestions) |

## Pattern types

- **literal** — case-insensitive substring match. Pattern `"—"` catches any em-dash.
- **regex** — Rust regex syntax. Pattern `"^.{1,10}$"` catches terse one-liners.

Directions:
- **avoid** — flag if pattern is **found** in the draft ("⚠ em-dash detected")
- **prefer** — flag if pattern is **absent** ("consider using 'quick note'")

Categories: `punctuation`, `style`, `structure`, `factual`, `deletion`.

Patterns auto-promote from `unconfirmed` → `confirmed` after appearing in 3+ pairs' drafts. This runs automatically on `finalize`.

## Conventions

- Tags: lowercase, comma-separated. First tag = content type, then context tags.
- Content type vocab: `email`, `prd`, `memo`, `proposal`, `blog`, `linkedin`, `x-post`, `internal-doc`, `external-doc`, `content`.
- Context tags: `pitch`, `followup`, `external`, `internal`, `apology`, `decline`, `intro`, `update`, `announcement`, `review`.
- Context line: audience + intent, e.g. `"cold intro to investor"` or `"internal PRD for payments v2"`.
- Cross-type learning: when deriving lessons, check if a pattern from one type applies to others. "Cut throat-clearing openers" is true for emails, PRDs, and proposals alike.

## Failure modes

- **Over-fitting to one pair.** Confirm across 2–3 before treating as a strong rule. Auto-promotion handles this.
- **Generic lessons.** If you can't name *what specifically changed*, don't store it.
- **Stale voice.** Re-check `recent` periodically. If a final contradicts an old lesson, flag it.
- **Silent edits.** Never delete lessons/patterns without surfacing the change.
- **Write-only graveyard.** Always create patterns alongside lessons — lessons without patterns don't lint.
- **Missing transcript.** When running outside pi, transcripts aren't auto-captured. Derivation falls back to diff-only analysis, which still works but with less context.
